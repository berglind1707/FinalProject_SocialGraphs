### Gryffindor


Gryffindor is without a doubt the house that gets the most attention throughout the series. 
The reason for that is because three of the main characters, Harry, Ron, and Hermione, are all sorted
into Gryffindor house and therefore it can be argued that the series is a bit biased towards Gryffindor.
The main characteristics that people from Gryffindor are known for are courage, chivalry, and loyalty. Even though
the emphasis is mostly on their positive traits they are far from being perfect.

Gryffindor holds many of the main characters that are stereotyped as daring, brave, and warm felt personalities, the word cloud manages to emphasize some of the describing words and keywords/names in the storyline.

   **1. Scrabbers and Crookshanks**: Two of the major housepets within the house; Scrabbers is Ron's cat and Crookshanks is Hermonies cat.
   
   **2. Signup and Sheet**: Refers to the signup sheet for Dumbledore's Army, everyone that wanted to join his side needed to sign the sheet. This indicates that a major of Gryffindor characters were loyal to Dumbledore's Army.
   
   **3. Grawp**: A giant and half-brother of Hagrid, he was frequently picked on by other giants for his short height. He correlated with Gryffindor, he has a major role in *The Order of the Phoenix* and takes place in the battle of Hogwarts as a part of Dumbledore's Army.
   
   **4. Cursebreaker**: Occupational title used by witches and wizards who removed, countered, or broke curses placed on objects or places for a living. Indicating that a partGryffindor graduates worked as curse breakers.
   
   **5. Locket**: One of the Horcruxes eight Lord Voldemort split his soules into. For him to be killed eternally all eight needed to be destroyed first.
   
   **6. Shrieking shack**: Abandoned house in Hogsmeade. For many years, villagers thought it was haunted because they often heard screams coming from inside, and Albus Dumbledore encouraged the rumor, as he was the one who commissioned it to Remus Lupin so that he would have a place for his monthly transformations into a werewolf. Harry Potter and Hermione Granger were led into the shack when Sirius Black, as a dog, dragged Ron off into the underground passage, located underneath the Whomping Willow While inside the shack Harry then found out who had betrayed his parents and Scabbers' true identity was revealed. The Shrieking Shack was later used by Lord Voldemort and several of his Death Eaters in 1998 as a hideout during the Battle of Hogwarts. Severus Snape was killed by Nagini in this very building
   
   **7. Bulletin**: Refers to the Harry Potter video games, if you get to play major Gryffindor characters: Harry, Ron, or Hermione you receive a sidequest on the bulletin board.
   
Overall the word cloud manages to sum both occupations and major story occurrences rather than personality properties of Gryffindor characters.

### Slytherin

Slytherin is the house that gets the worst reputation throughout the entire series.
While there is significantly more emphasis on Slytherins bad characteristics they have some
very desirable characteristics as well. The selection hat tended to select people who had
characteristics such as cunning, ambitions, leadership abilities and esourcefulness. Slytherin is often
associated with dark magic and the characters are often seen as devious, selfish and cruel even though that is definitely
not the case for all of them.

Slytherin is thought of as the evil characters of the stories that think higher of themselves than characters of other houses due to their high proportion of pure-blood wizards within the house.

   **1. Kreacher**: Voldemorts house elf.
   
   **2. Purity and Inbreeding**: Referning to the high proportion of pure-blood wizards within Slytherin.
   
   **3. Manor**: Manor was the home of the wealthy pure-blood Malfoy family, located in Wiltshire, England. It was mainly used as the base of operations for Lord Voldemort and the Death Eaters during the Second Wizarding War.
   
   **4. Densaugeo**: Hex which causes the teeth to elongate at a grotesque, alarming rate. Used early on in the stories by Slytherin students.
   
   **5. Disowned**: Indicating that several Slytherin characters have been disowned by their parents.
   
   **5. Locket**: One of the Horcruxes eight Lord Voldemort split his soules into. For him to be killed eternally all eight needed to be destroyed first.
   
   **6. Shrieking shack**: Abandoned house in Hogsmeade. For many years, villagers thought it was haunted because they often heard screams coming from inside, and Albus Dumbledore encouraged the rumor, as he was the one who commissioned it to Remus Lupin so that he would have a place for his monthly transformations into a werewolf.

Overall the word cloud manages to sum up the identities of Slytherin along with important objects of the storyline.

### Hufflepuff

Hufflepuff is known to be the most inclusive house of the four.
Students who were chosen to this house were known to be hard-working, loyal, and honest
as well as taking everybody as an equal. What is very interesting about Hufflepuff house is
that the fewest dark vizards belonged to that house.

JK. Rowling wrote the stories with Gryffindor characters as main characters and used Slytherin characters as opposed to the main characters, overall Slytherin represents the bad guys. That makes the characters of Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw side characters to the story and they have significantly less weight in the stories. Hufflepuff was left out a lot in the stories so when JK. Rowling started working on Fantastic Beasts, which is a side story to Harry Potter, she emphasized the Hufflepuff house to make their role bigger in the joint stories. This makes up for most of the big words in their word cloud. We didn't grasp characters from the fantastic beast stories unless they appeared in the harry potter stories so that's why you can see some of the main character names from there.

   **1. Tina, Kowalski, Queenie, and Creedence:** The main characters from the Fantastic Beasts movies.

   **2. Suitcase**: Refers to the suitcase that Newt stored is magical creatures in.

   **3. Obsucurus**: An Obscurus was the manifestation of the repressed energy of a young wizard or witch. Described as a "dark" and "parasitic" force, an Obscurus was created when the wizard child in question consciously attempted to repress their magical abilities or were forced to do so through physical or psychological abuse. Creedence in the fantastic beasts was an Obscurus.

   **4. MACUSA**: Stands for The Magical Congress of the United States of America, they were involved a lot in the storyline of the Fantastic Beasts.

   **5. Greenhouse**: This is one of few that refer to the Harry Potter stories. It refers to the only teacher who was a known Hufflepuff; Madam Sprout who taught Herbology in the **greenhouses**.
    
These words confirm the minor role Hufflepuff had in the Harry Potter stories and clearly state the major role JK. Rowling gave them in the Fantastic Beasts. This is assumption is supported by the fact that the place where the only Hufflepuff teacher teaches its course. The only Hufflepuff character that played a big role in the stories was Cedric Diggory who was killed in the same story as he was introduced.

### Ravenclaw

Students who were chosen into Ravenclaw house were known for their wisdom, intelligence, and willingness to learn.
With that being said many of Ravenclaw members were very ambitious and talented students. There were rumors from
Slytherin house that Ravenclaw students weren‘t as perfect as they seemed since they would without blinking an eye
backstab each other, and students from other houses, in order to get higher grades.

Ravenclaw, like Hufflepuff is a minor of the story but still has significantly more weight than Hufflepuff. The word cloud overall seems to be centered around Gilderoy Lockhart who is the biggest active character of Ravenclaw along with Luna Lovegood. Words that refer straight to his presence in Ravenclaw are:

  **1. Fraudulence, Fraudulent, and Fraud**: Gilderoy Lockhart was an immoderately vainglorious, self-obsessed, egocentric, and narcissistic self-promoter who claimed to have accomplished multiple heroic deeds. However, in reality, he was nothing but a charlatan who took credit for other wizards and witches' achievements. So in general he was very **fraudulent**.
  
  **2. Shampoo**: Referring to the shampoo, made from Occamy egg yolks, that was a potion invented by Gilderoy Lockhart that supposedly guaranteed "locks of lustrous luminosity and great hair, but in reality was a fraud.
  
  **3. Branagh**: Gilderoy Lockhart was played by Branagh.
  
  **4. Peacock**: Description to Gilderoy, it means that he is arrogant or likes dressing or behaving in a way that draws attention to himself.
  
Other noticeable words in the Ravenclaw word cloud:

  **1. Vampire**: Quirell was a villain in *The Philosophers's Stone* stories. He came across as scittish and weird since he was possessed by Lord Voldemort which wasn't a known fact. The rumor was that he had been in a vampire attack.
  
  **2. Baron**: Refers to the Bloody Baron which is the Slytherin's house ghost so maybe he should rather be in their word cloud. **BUT** The Bloody Baron was in love with The Gray Lady, Ravenclaws house ghost(she is the ghost of Helena Ravenclaw, the daughter of Rowena Ravenclaw who founded the house). When she denied his love he killed her. His part in Ravenclaws story is the consequence of this action. 
  
**Very IMPORTANT side note**: The fact that the Bloody Baron killed Helena Ravenclaw isn't public knowledge in the story.  Helena tells Harry and Luna Lovegood this in *The Deathly Hallows* book but in-universe this isn't a known fact. This fact shows that the word clouds can reflect meta-knowledge and connections of the stories. This can explain some words that we might think are random in the context of some houses.

![Hi there](images/withoutHouses_wordcloud.png)

It's a surprise that the word cloud generated for characters without a house has some context. 

   **1. Smelting**: Refers to the school that the Dursleys anticipated sending Harry Potter to before Hagrid fetched him to Hogwarts. This shows a correlation to the character pages of the Dursley characters, Harry's mother's family who took care of him after his parents were killed by Voldemort.
    
   **2. Colony**: Refers to the Giant and the Forbidden Forest centaur colony indicating that a part of the characters without a house come from either of these colonies.
    
   **3. Kwikspell**: Kwikspell is a correspondence course in beginner's magic run by the Kwikspell Company. The course is designed to help adult witches and wizards brush up on their magical skills. This indicates that a lot of the characters without a house are people with magical abilities that haven't practiced magic.
    
   **4. Privet**: The street that the Dursley family lives in.
    
This word cloud also holds some characters that we weren't able to grasp such as **Kreacher** the house-elf, **Madame** who is Hagrids girlfriend a half-giant from France, **Barty** a young wizard who became loyal to Voldemort early on, and **Stan** the conductor and helper of the Knight Bus as well as an intended death eater. They seem to have a lot of mentiones within characters without a house.

Welcome to our website!
This website is a part of our final project in the course Social Graphs and Interactions at DTU. The story of Harry Potter, his friends and adventures are one of the most popular book series of our generation. Our aim is to gain a deeper understanding and insights into the Harry Potter universe so that we (and you!) are better prepared for our christmas binging of Harry Potter this year.

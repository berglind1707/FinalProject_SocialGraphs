Welcome to our website!
This website is a part of our final project in the course Social Graphs and Interactions at DTU. The story of Harry Potter, his friends and adventures are one of the most popular book series of our generation. Our aim is to gain a deeper understanding and insights into the Harry Potter universe so that we (and you!) are better prepared for our christmas binging of Harry Potter this year.

Our main emphasis was spotting differences of the houses: Gryffindor, Slytherin, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw and characters without a house. Differences in network structure and distribution of minority groups within the total network, sentiment, most frequent word occurrences, and communities extensively. We will try to sum up each house using word clouds. Communities within each house are detected using the Louvain algorithm. We are interested in if the sentiment for these communities is reflected in their top words by TF-IDF weights. Finally, we were interested in the comparison of the storyline of the books vs. the movies. We carried out a sentiment analysis of either for comparison and also wanted to see if we were able to track each story based on their sentiment development.

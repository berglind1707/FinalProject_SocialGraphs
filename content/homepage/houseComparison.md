Almennt um hvað við ætlum að gera hér


### Gryffindor


Gryffindor is without a doubt the house that gets the most attention throughout the series. 
The reason for that is because three of the main characters, Harry, Ron, and Hermione, are all sorted
into Gryffindor house and therefore it can be argued that the series is a bit biased towards Gryffindor.
The main characteristics that people from Gryffindor are known for are courage, chivalry, and loyalty. Even though
the emphasis is mostly on their positive traits they are far from being perfect.

### Slytherin

Slytherin is the house that gets the worst reputation throughout the entire series.
While there is significantly more emphasis on Slytherins bad characteristics they have some
very desirable characteristics as well. The selection hat tended to select people who had
characteristics such as cunning, ambitions, leadership abilities and esourcefulness. Slytherin is often
associated with dark magic and the characters are often seen as devious, selfish and cruel even though that is definitely
not the case for all of them.

### Hufflepuff

Hufflepuff is known to be the most inclusive house of the four.
Students who were chosen to this house were known to be hard-working, loyal, and honest
as well as taking everybody as an equal. What is very interesting about Hufflepuff house is
that the fewest dark vizards belonged to that house.

### Ravenclaw

Students who were chosen into Ravenclaw house were known for their wisdom, intelligence, and willingness to learn.
With that being said many of Ravenclaw members were very ambitious and talented students. There were rumors from
Slytherin house that Ravenclaw students weren‘t as perfect as they seemed since they would without blinking an eye
backstab each other, and students from other houses, in order to get higher grades.

### Gryffindor


Gryffindor

Gryffindor is without a doubt the house that gets the most attention throughout the series. 
The reason for that is because three of main characters, Harry, Ron and Hermione, are all
sorted into Gryffindor house and therefor it can be argued that the series are a bit biased towards Gryffindor.
The main characteristics that people from Gryffindor are known for are courage, chivalry and loyality.
Even though the emphatisis is mostly on their postive traits they are far from being perfect.

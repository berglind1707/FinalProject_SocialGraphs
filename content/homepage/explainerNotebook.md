**_To be able to run the code all files needed along with the notebook are zipped in the git repo link above.
Even though all files are included, to run the notebook you just need characters folder, harry_potter_data.csv file and the photos in the folder.
Everything else in the zip file is generated by the code and is only included for viewing purposes. Have fun!_**

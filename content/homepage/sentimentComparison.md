**_Result:_** At first sight, the sentiment seems to be somehow correlated with an exception for *The Goblet of Fire*. This significant difference is since the book closely emphasizes the anger and disappointment Dumbledore expresses when Harry is chosen one to participate in the Triwizard Tournament. The movie captures the whole tournament as an exciting event with a lot of festive gatherings while the sent of it is a bit more serious in the books. In Genral it was expected to see some differance in the sentiment since the books are up to 1000 pages and a lot of content that might not affect the story that much is cut out for the movies.

The VADER score scale ranges from -1 to 1 where -1 is the most negative and 1 is the happiest. The movie sentiments manage to cover close to 50% of the scale while the books stay more consistent in sentiment and cover just around 30% of the entire scale. The Harry Potter stories use a lot of really dark words and many scenes take place in unhappy and scary places but on the other hand, there are a lot of truly magical scenes that result in a happy sentiment, such as the Christmas scenes, festive events and final scenes of each movie. These differences result in a rather balanced average sentiment.


Overall we can say that with an exception of *The Goblet of Fire* story that the sentiment for the entire storyline in the books and movies is rather correlated. The first movie *The Philosopher's Stone* seems to be the happiest story considering both sentiments of the book and movies. It clearly describes the magical environment present in the story and the positive experience of Hogwarts. The saddest story is noticeably *The Deathly Hallows* which was expected due to the horrific storyline and events of the story.

**_Result:_** Looking at the individual stories we can see that there is a clear trend of all stories. They start of happy developing into a wide-ranging storyline that reaches a tragic sad point near the end but always results in a happy ending. This is reflected in the development of sentiment scores throughout the stories. After some research, we figured out that the happiest scenes just after the middle of each story are for the Christmas scenes.

Analyzing the curve it is interesting to mention which event causes the most dramatic curve drop in each story:

__*The Philosopher's Stone*__: Harry discovers the existence of Voldemort and the story behind his scar.

__*The Chamber of Secret's*__: No drastic drops to mention, this story describes Harry's wellbeing as a wizard and his discoveries of magical abilities. The biggest accomplishment is killing the great Basilisk snake, a snake bred with Salazar Slytherin's intent to murder Muggle-borns

__*The Prisoner of Azkaban*__: Near the end, Sirius Black vanishes which causes enormous grief for Harry since he knows his parents and he wanted to establish a closer connection with him.

__*The Goblet of Fire*__: There are various drops here describing the dark scenes of the Triwizard Tournament. The biggest drop near the end reflects on the return of Voldemort and his murder of Cedric Diggory in the Maze challenge.

__*The Order of the Pheonix*__: The darkest story except for *The Deathly Hallows* since Voldemort has returned but everyone is in denial. there are increased dark scenes due to his return. Voldemort has started gathering his army again, and a lot of his previous allies are introduced to the story for example Bellatrix Lestrange once she escapes Azkaban. The biggest drops toward the end represent the murder of Sirius Balck committed by Bellatrix Lestrange. Dark matters are all over in this movie indicating the war upon all wizards.

__*The Half-Blood Prince*__: The biggest drop represents the killing of Dumbledore in the Astronomy Tower.

__*The Deathly Hallows*__: The entire storyline is variating in sentiment scores but overall there are a lot of horrific events in this story. The big drops near the end indicate the killing of Severus Snape and the War of Hogwarts. 

Even though Christmas scenes and Sorting Hat + Festive Dinners gain a happy sentiment score it is also noticeable that the final scene of *The Deathly Hallows* that winds into the future for the main characters is extremely happy in sentiment.
